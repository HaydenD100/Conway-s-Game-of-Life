# What is Conway's Game of Life
Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton created by John Horton Conway in 1970.

# Rules
The game is made of a grid of cells. Each cell is either dead or alive. Every update of the game each cell has to follow 4 rules.

 1.Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
 2.Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
 3.Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
 4.Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

# Features
You can pause and play the simulation at anytime by pressing the "p" key this allows you to make changes to the game at anytime.
You can make cells alive or dead at anytime using the mouse button, "Left Click" to make a cell alive and "Right Click" to make the cell dead.
Pressing "g" display a grid of the cells making it easier to edit cells.
